## Overview
This is a side-scrolling game inspired by Flappy Bird, built using only vanilla JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.

## Features
- **Fully responsive design** – Ensures smooth gameplay across all devices, from desktops to mobile phones.
- **Timer to track gameplay duration** – Allows players to challenge themselves by keeping track of their survival time.
- **Rechargeable energy system for players** – Adds a strategic element where players must manage their energy to maintain flight.
- **Speed boost functionality** – Introduces an element of risk and reward, allowing players to gain temporary bursts of speed. However, improper timing can make maneuvering more challenging, increasing the difficulty of avoiding obstacles.

## Future Developments
### Next Steps (Planned Timeline)
**Short-Term (Next 2 Weeks):**
- Add restart logic: Implement an event listener for game-over detection and a restart function
- Introduce in-game instructions for first-time players

**Mid-Term (Next Month):**
- Improve speed boost mechanics to make transitions smoother (e.g., prevent boosting until the color changes based on recharge time)

**Long-Term (Ongoing Enhancements):**
- Enhance the visual appeal of the overlay (e.g., animated dino soaring around)
