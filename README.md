I built the game skeleton for my game using Franks laboratory's tutorial on Side-Scrolling Games. 
I followed this up to 1.27.5 and it can be accessed [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vGRbs-HqBJE/).

This was more advanced than I expected - and it took longer to complete & understand.

Hence the features I added were quite basic: 
- Game Instructions: I added an overlay with the game instructions & a button to begin. 
- Player + Obstacles: I added a bird image as the player and a turtle as the obstacles

Next steps: 
- Add restart logic: event listener when game is over + restart function
- Make speeding less jumpy - perhaps can't speed until colour has changed which is based on time to recharge
- Make the overlay more visually interesting (eg. dino soaring around)
- Make the game unlimited and so that scroll speed increases as time goes higher
- Launch as a mobile app??
