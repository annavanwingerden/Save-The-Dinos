I built the game skeleton for my game using Franks laboratory's tutorial on Side-Scrolling Games. 
I followed this up to 1.27.5: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vGRbs-HqBJE.

Features I added: 
- Game Instructions: I added an overlay with the game instructions to begin. 
- Player + Obstacles: I added a bird image as the player and a turtle as the obstacles
